# Setup

## Running in Dev Mode

Run `npm run dev`. New Tailwind classes will require a page reload.

## Building

TBD...

# Audio Issues

1. The sine wave is nice and all, but there should at least be an onset
   envelope.
2. I need different wave forms.


# Content Issues

1. Need the right fonts. I'm still befuddled by this one.


# To Consider

- Consider setting this up as an `elm-pages` project, if for no other reason
  than to get the pre-rendered html.

- See if we can get byzhtml (https://github.com/danielgarthur/byzhtml) included
  with the build rather than needing the CDN.

- See if you can deploy this using github pages.
