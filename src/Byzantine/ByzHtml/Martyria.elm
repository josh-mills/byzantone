## Notes on Names

  - Baris in the SBMuFL terminology is indicated as `martyriaZoBelow`

  - The chromatic signature that appears with Pa in the hard chromatic genus and
    Di in the soft chromatic is derived from a highly stylized βύτα (used as
    ordinal for 2, indicating the second mode), which looked something like a
    modern "u". For the soft chromatic, it includes the two dots. SBMuFL calls
    these "hardChromaticPa" and "softChromaticDi", respectively.

  - The chromatic signature that appears with Di in the hard chromatic genus and
    Pa in the soft is a small circle with a left-to-right upward diagonal slash
    called _nenano_. This is altered with a crossbar on the upper diagonal in
    the soft chromatic. SBMuFL calls these "hardChromaticDi" and
    "softChromaticKe".
